# XML/JSON Beautifier Application

Welcome to the XML/JSON Beautifier application! This application allows you to beautify your XML and JSON content easily through a simple web interface. For demonstration purposes, JSON beautification is handled client-side, while XML beautification requires server-side processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you do not have Node.js installed, please visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Running the Application

1. In the terminal, execute `npm start` to start the server. This command will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## How to Use

1. Once the application loads, you will see a simple form with a dropdown to select the format (JSON or XML), a textarea to input your text, and a submit button.
2. Select "XML" from the dropdown if you are inputting XML content. Submit your XML data by clicking the "Beautify" button, and the server will process your request at the `/beautify` endpoint, returning beautified XML. If you select "JSON", the application will format the JSON using `JSON.stringify` client-side.
3. Paste your unformatted XML or JSON into the textarea.
4. For JSON, beautification happens immediately on the client side. The beautified result will be displayed below the form.
5. It is important to note that the form action targets `/beautify`, which involves server interaction for XML data processing.

## Application Structure

- `public/index.html`: The front-end interface for the application.
- `public/styles.css`: Contains the styling for the application to ensure it is visually appealing.
- `server.js`: The server-side logic to handle requests, including dealing explicitly with XML input and beautification.
- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

## Features

- Select between JSON or XML input.
- Beautify XML content using server-side logic.
- Client-side JSON formatting for demonstration purposes.
- Explicit handling and error feedback for both XML and JSON, enhancing user experience by providing clear instructions and expectations for each input type.

Thank you for using the XML/JSON Beautifier application!
